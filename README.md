1st iteration of a feed reader for my new art blog.

The state of feed readers in 2020 seems to be that many sites don't use them and when they do they are not formatted or use the same standards or implementations. This causes lots of inconsistencies and work to use.  

For the future I plan to redo this using a scraper to a database to accomplish this better.
